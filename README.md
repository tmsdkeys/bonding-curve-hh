# AI Chatbot Bonding Curve Demo

A comprehensive demonstration of Fluent's "blended app" capabilities, showcasing an AI-powered chatbot where user interactions drive token economics through a sophisticated sigmoid bonding curve system.

## üéØ Use Case & Value Proposition

This project demonstrates how blockchain technology can create sustainable economic incentives for high-quality digital interactions. Users participate in an AI-moderated community where:

- **Quality content gets rewarded** - AI judges messages and mints tokens for valuable contributions
- **Economic participation** - Users buy tokens through a bonding curve that adjusts price based on supply
- **Community-driven value** - Token price reflects the collective quality of community interactions
- **Transparent economics** - All interactions, judgments, and rewards are publicly verifiable on-chain

## üîÑ Application Flow

The AI Chatbot Bonding Curve creates a complete economic loop that incentivizes meaningful participation:

> **Note**: This repository contains the **smart contract backend infrastructure**. The complete application is designed to include a frontend web interface where users can interact with the AI chatbot naturally. This repository focuses on the blockchain mechanics and uses admin functions and test scripts to simulate user interactions for development and validation purposes.

### 1. Token Acquisition

Users purchase **$CBT (Chatbot Tokens)** through a sigmoid bonding curve:

- Price increases as more tokens are minted (early participants get better prices)
- Mathematical curve ensures fair price discovery
- ETH spent goes into a shared liquidity pool

### 2. Message Participation  

Users spend $CBT tokens to send messages to the AI chatbot:

- Each message costs a small fee (burned from supply)
- Messages are stored on-chain for transparency
- Natural spam prevention through economic cost

### 3. AI Curation & Judgment

An AI system selectively evaluates messages based on quality, creativity, and community value:

- **Liked messages**: Author receives $CBT token rewards (minted to supply)
- **Disliked messages**: Tokens are burned from total supply (deflationary pressure)  
- **No judgment**: Most messages receive no AI response (selective curation)

### 4. Economic Feedback Loop

AI judgments create immediate economic impact:

- **Likes increase supply** ‚Üí More tokens in circulation ‚Üí Potential price adjustment
- **Dislikes decrease supply** ‚Üí Deflationary pressure ‚Üí Potential price increase
- **Message fees always burn tokens** ‚Üí Continuous deflationary baseline

### 5. Community Dynamics

The system creates natural incentives for quality participation:

- High-quality contributors earn token rewards
- Token holders benefit from overall community quality through price appreciation  
- Self-regulating system where spam becomes economically unfeasible

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

This demonstration showcases two different implementation approaches, highlighting Fluent's flexibility in supporting multiple execution environments:

### Solidity Mode

Pure Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implementation using advanced Solidity techniques:

- **Polynomial approximation** for sigmoid curve calculations
- **Gas-optimized** mathematical operations
- **ERC-20 token standards** with advanced minting/burning mechanics
- **Role-based access control** for security and governance

### Blended Mode  

Hybrid implementation combining Solidity smart contracts with Rust-powered mathematical operations:

- **Rust contracts** handle computationally expensive sigmoid calculations
- **Native precision** using Rust's mathematical libraries
- **Optimized performance** for complex curve operations
- **Seamless interoperability** between EVM and WebAssembly runtimes

## üöÄ Implementation Modes

This starter kit provides two complete implementations to demonstrate different approaches:

### üìä [Solidity Mode](./docs/solidity-mode.md)

Complete implementation using pure Solidity smart contracts. Perfect for:

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

1. **Clone and setup:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai-chatbot-bonding-curve
   npm install
   ```

2. **Choose your implementation mode:**
   - For Solidity Mode: Follow the [Solidity Mode Guide](./docs/solidity-mode.md)
   - For Blended Mode: Follow the [Blended Mode Guide](./docs/blended-mode.md)

3. **Run the system:**

   ```bash
   # Compile contracts
   npm run compile
   
   # Run comprehensive tests (simulates user flows)
   npm run test:phase-1:complete
   
   # Deploy to local network
   npm run deploy:local
   ```

> **Repository Scope**: This repository contains the complete smart contract infrastructure and testing suite. Test scripts use admin functions and mock user interactions to validate the economic mechanics. In a production deployment, these contracts would be integrated with a frontend application providing the user interface for natural AI chatbot interactions.

## üéÆ Interactive Demo

Experience the complete ecosystem in action through comprehensive test scripts that simulate real user interactions:

```bash
# Run the full ecosystem demonstration (simulates multiple users)
npm run demo:ecosystem

# Validate production readiness
npm run validate:production-ready
```

> **Frontend Integration**: While this repository provides the complete smart contract backend, the system is designed to be integrated with a web frontend where users can naturally interact with the AI chatbot, buy/sell tokens, and view real-time community statistics. The test scripts in this repository demonstrate the full user journey that would be implemented in a production frontend application.
